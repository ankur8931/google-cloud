Persistent disks vs SSDs
Immutable blobs - Cloud storage
OLTP - Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner
NoSQL - HTML/XML - Datastore
No SQL- key/value - Hive/BigTable
Data into cloud storage - transfer service
------------------------------------------
Block Storage - physical form - lower level of granularity, unstructured data.
Meant to be used for VMs.
Location tied to VM location.
Compute Engine VMs - Persistent -> 1) Standard 2) SSD, Local SSD, Cloud Storage

Cloud Storage - Buckets, globally unique, location, storage classes
                Multi-regional, regional, nearline, coldline
                HDFS=Cloud Storage in Google
                
SQL Interface for filedata - BigQuery=Hive (faster than Hive, columunar data storage format).
                           - Latency higher than BigTable.
                           - Cannot be used for OLTP, but OLAP.

Transaction Processing - Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, ACID/OLTP. 
                       - OLTP - strict write consistency, OLAP does not.
                       - Cloud Spanner (horizontal scaling)
                       
Datastore - alternate for MongoDB, CouchDB, key/value structure.
          - not used for OLTP, OLAP.
          - query exec depends on size of returned set.
          - don't use for write-intensive data.
          
Bigtable - Columunar datastore, fast scan of sequential key values. 
         - Good for sparse data.
